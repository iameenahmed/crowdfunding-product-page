## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile first workflow
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- ReactJS
- Zustand

### What I learned

This project was really fun to do, It has a lot to tackle, from design hustles to functionality, It helps me, more specifically saying it urges me to learn about state management, and to do so I came across the Zustand, Which is powerful, lightweight, easy to learn, easy to implement and work with. Furthermore, it also helps me to learn about working with Modals, and i would really like to mention the built-in method of JavaScript: _toLacaleString()_ which formats the large numbers with commas.
